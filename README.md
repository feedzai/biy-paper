    alt="Two scatterplots. The scatterplot on the left has three well-separated clusters, along with their respective target and predicted bounding boxes almost overlapping. The scatterplot on the right has a compact cluster in the upper-right corner and five outliers in the lower-left corner. Besides the outliers, four points predicted by GPT-4o are also shown, positioned away from the target outliers and forming a diagonal near the lower-left corner among themselves." />
